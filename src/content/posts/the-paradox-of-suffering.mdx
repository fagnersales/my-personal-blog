A couple of days ago I realized how much I was suffering to complete a certain task. It wasn't something I was being forced to do, or something that important as well, but I was still suffering and getting so stressed to finish it.

I started to think "Why should I keep doing this?" even feeling so bad, I kept doing it because I wanted to see that task DONE.

Hours after those thoughts, I managed to finish it. But at what cost? and what I felt after seeing it done?

At the first moment, I don't even felt relief or something, I was just tired and went to my bed.

The next day I started asking myself "Why did I have to suffer to finish it? Was it necessary? Could I have completely it happily or at least normally?" I couldn't answer it to myself and that's why I'm writing it, how important was for me to suffer in that specific moment? Would I finish the task if I didn't suffer or if I'd enjoy?

I am sure I would finish it, but maybe I wouldn't value the same way I'm valuing right now. My conclusion is that suffering it's important for us to understand the value of something.

I would have surely finished it without suffering, but I for sure wouldn't think the same way I'm thinking now. I wouldn't even say "Hey, it was me who finished it!" it would be just another task that I've done and it's in my past, but not in my present mind.

Even if I did understand the perfect concept of suffering and how it makes stuff valuable in the future, there's still a question: In the moment that the suffering occurs, is it possible to not suffer, simple ignoring it or do we have to feel trully sad/mad in the moment to give us the result after finishing what we want? What if we don't even manage to handle that feeling and stop doing it? I still don't know what to think about suffering and maybe there's no answer for it as well.
