JavaScript is a programming language that allows to manipulate web page's elements, doing simple modifications or even complex operations, such as rendering a map, find data in other plataforms through the use of [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), show 2D/3D content, etc. If you have seen something like that in a web page, you can bet that was made using JavaScript.

Fundamentally JavaScript works with two other tools, being them [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) (A markup language that is used to show content or give a meaning to some content of the page, for example, defining paragraphs, headings, data tables, etc.) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) (A stylesheet language that allows the HTML content to be stylized, for example, adding colors, borders, shadows, fonts, etc.)

## Everyday things you use JavaScript (and maybe don't know)

### Logging into a page, such as Instagram, Twitter, etc.

For a successful authentication, it is necessary for the data you enter to be sent to the system that handles that page, in order to validate and confirm that the data is correct. Only then can your content (profile picture, name, posts, etc.) be displayed.

### Posting a photo on Instagram

The image needs to be processed and sent to Instagram's database.

### Sending a message to someone

It is similar to the case of an image, where the content needs to be encrypted and stored somewhere and then made available to the user (in some cases, it can be different, where the message is not even stored for security and privacy reasons).

### Among many other things, from the simplest to the most complex!
