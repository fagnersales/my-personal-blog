This post was written once I woke up because I wanted to get it done.

## Everything is a draft
Everything we do is just a draft, and it doesn't mean you shouldn't finish it; instead, it means you don't need to be perfect in order to finish. It's obvious when we say that nothing is perfect, yet we keep racing and chasing a stage of perfection that we'll never reach. As for the reason we do that, it reamins unknown. However, thinking that everything is a draft makes it easier to tell ourselves that we've accomplished it, and it's okay to make it done.

## There is no editing stage
When you make a mistake, keep going. A mistake is nothing more than a way to learn in life. Of course, if you are writing a book you should correct your sentences, but you don't need to start an endless editing stage because nothing is perfect. This can lead to a never-ending cycle of editing and editing. Every second you spend doing something, you get better at it, you learn better ways of doing the same thing. So, editing won't help you get it done; it will only help you to find mistakes, fix them, get better, find more mistakes, fix them, get better and the cyclic pattern keeps circling.

## Learn to accept
When you release something into the world, a book, a music, you lose control of it. It's no longer your responsbiility. Learn to accept the results and make another one. If it does well, that's great; now you know the path to improve further. If it doesn't do well, that's also okay; you can learn from your mistakes, avoid them in the future, and try a different way when you release your next creation.

## "Fake it until you make it"
Pretending you know what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you're doing, so just accept that you know what you're doing even if you don't. Doesn't matter whether know or not; if you need to learn something in the process, that's okayâ€” you can do that and still keep going. However, if you don't try because you don't know, then you'll never know, and even worse, you'd never have tried in the first place.

## Banish procrastination
If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it. You don't need to never try it again, you can do it later on, but move on to the next idea. The process of experiencing a new idea will usually boost yourself more than you think you're capable of, and if that's not enough to make the idea done, perhaps it's not the right time for it, or it's not a good idea in the first place. 
Avoid spending excessive time trying to perfect it or make it work;just move to something else and keep yourself busy and always boosted with the 'new idea'.

## Done? Throw it away
The point is not finishing, but moving on to the next one, you'll be one project better, one project wiser, one project closer to your personal record. Once you're done, you can throw it away. You don't have to keep working on it, you are done! Smash the pots, burn the paints, art isn't the art, the art is never the art, the art is the thing that happens inside you when make and the feeling in the heart of the beholder. Just throw it away, move to the next one and repeat the cycle.

## Imperfection > Perfection
Perfection is not feasible, achievable; it's just boring and keeps you away from being done. You'll never achieve, which means you'll never be done. It doesn't mean you have to have low standards, but rather, understand that you're done. let it go.

## Failure is progress
If you fail, you're not one step away from achieving it, instead, you're smarter, you're better, failing is always a good thing. Trusting someone who has never failed is the same of trusting someone that never took the risk, someone that never did. You have to fail to learn, to understand, to master. Accept your failure as progress, and keep failiing and making mistakes.

## Destruction is a variant of done
When you are done, you are free to move on. When you destroy the thing, you are also done, whether it was intentional or not. Some situations require destruction, and in doing so, you have not failed; you've found ten thousand waysin which it doesn't work.

## Ideas are worthless
You're not the first one to have this idea; someone else has already thought the same. Don't assume you're unique because of that, but you can become unique if you act on it. It doesn't mean you have to chase the idea of doing all the ideas that you've got, some of them you don't need to do, you don't want to do, so give it away, post it somewhere else, tell it to someone else, don't throw into the trash the ideas you're not doing, don't claim exclusive ownership of them.

## Done is the engine of more
Being done is wonderful, being done is addictive, being done is the only way to find out what is next.

I got extremely inspired by a YouTube video called "How To Finish Everything with the Cult Of Done" (you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus)) and I thought to myself "It would be awesome to show this to other people," and here I am.
